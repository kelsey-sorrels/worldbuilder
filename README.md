==========

This project is a proof of concept world builder using the Processing framework.

## Running
* git clone https://github.com/aaron-santos/processingworldbuilder
* Open Processing
* Navigate to `File` | `Open`
* Select processingworldbuilder/processingworldbuilder.pde
* Click `Open`
* Click the `Run` button

Press `z` to toggle between geographical and political displays.
    
## Notes
The simulation runs slowly. An effort as been made to improve the performance, but there is a lot of work still left
to be done.
Remember: a water model is running to simulate rivers and ocean, an amospheric simulation is running which
transports water vapor, vegetation is grown in response to soil moisture, and migrants are searching for ideal
locations to start a city.

Enjoy making new worlds!
